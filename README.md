# Calculator
This project involves building a calculator that runs on the web. 

In this project, I further solidified my understanding of the Javascript 
DOM as this helped in enabling my values to be displayed on the screen.

In addition, I futher learnt how powerful conditional statements are, as they helped me specify what the calculator should do in special cases based on the 
input selected by the user.

It also provided me with a refresher on writing simple javascript functions. This simple functions perform the operations in the calculator app.

Even though I would admit that my CSS for now is not spectacular, I was able to make the calculator a bit visually appealing.
